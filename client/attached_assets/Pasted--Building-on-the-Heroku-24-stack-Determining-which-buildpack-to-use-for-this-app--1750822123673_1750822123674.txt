-----> Python app detected
 !     Error: Couldn't find any supported Python package manager files.
 !     
 !     A Python app on Heroku must have either a 'requirements.txt',
 !     'Pipfile', 'poetry.lock' or 'uv.lock' package manager file in
 !     the root directory of its source code.
 !     
 !     Currently the root directory of your app contains:
 !     
 !     app.json
 !     attached_assets/
 !     azul-logo.png
 !     boarding-pass-generator/
 !     client/
 !     components.json
 !     drizzle.config.ts
 !     .env.example
 !     .gitignore
 !     package.json
 !     package-lock.json
 !     postcss.config.js
 !     Procfile
 !     README.md
 !     .replit
 !     replit.md
 !     runtime.txt
 !     server/
 !     shared/
 !     sistema-cartoes-embarque-completo.md
 !     tailwind.config.ts
 !     tsconfig.json
 !     vite.config.ts
 !     
 !     If your app already has a package manager file, check that it:
 !     
 !     1. Is in the top level directory (not a subdirectory).
 !     2. Has the correct spelling (the filenames are case-sensitive).
 !     3. Isn't listed in '.gitignore' or '.slugignore'.
 !     4. Has been added to the Git repository using 'git add --all'
 !        and then committed using 'git commit'.
 !     
 !     Otherwise, add a package manager file to your app. If your app has
 !     no dependencies, then create an empty 'requirements.txt' file.
 !     
 !     If you aren't sure which package manager to use, we recommend
 !     trying uv, since it supports lockfiles, is extremely fast, and
 !     is actively maintained by a full-time team:
 !     https://docs.astral.sh/uv/
